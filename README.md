MatLab was used to clean and export a .csv file of the data collected from an experiment, where a signal was collected by slipping a certain material through a sensor at a given speed. Columns were the value of the signal at a given timestep, signaled at 600Hz, while rows are individual trials of each slippage, separated into cycles, which are repeated identical pulls in the same trial. 
cyclesPredict is a ipynb predictor and classifier made with sci-kit learn to first classify the type of material something is given by a time series, followed with a regressor to predict speed given that the initial prediction of material was correct. 
Machine Learning techniques implemented and used contatain Random Forest Regressors, Random Forest Classifiers, One Hot Encoding, Pipelines, and Cross Validation.
