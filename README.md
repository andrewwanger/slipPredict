cyclesPredict is a ipynb predictor and classifier made with sci-kit learn to first classify the type of material something is given by a time series, followed with a regressor to predict speed given that the initial prediction of material was correct. 
Machine Learning techniques implemented and used contatain Random Forest Regressors, Random Forest Classifiers, One Hot Encoding, Pipelines, and Cross Validation.
